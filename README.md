Serde Pickle Serialization Library
==================================

[Documentation](https://birkenfeld.github.io/serde-pickle/serde_pickle/index.html)

This crate is a Rust library for parsing and generating Python pickle
streams. It is built upon [Serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde), a high
performance generic serialization framework.

Notes
-----

The test suite currently only works with the nightly-based `serde_macros`.
